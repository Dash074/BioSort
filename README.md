# BioSort 

Biosort is a mobile application designed to classify and segregate waste into two categories: biodegradable and non-biodegradable. The app uses a machine learning model to predict the type of waste based on images, helping promote environmental sustainability through effective waste management.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Upload images of waste to determine whether they are biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
- **Real-time Prediction**: Uses a trained machine learning model to provide fast and accurate predictions.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design for seamless user experience.
- **Flutter Application**: Built using Flutter for cross-platform compatibility (iOS & Android).
- **Backend Integration**: Powered by a FastAPI server that handles image processing and classification.

## Technologies Used:
### Frontend
- **Flutter**: Framework for building the mobile application.
### Backend
- **Python**: Used for developing machine learning models and server logic.
- **TensorFlow**: Framework used to create and train the machine learning model.
- **FastAPI**: Python-based backend framework that serves the classification model.
- **Xception Model**: A deep learning model trained to classify waste as biodegradable or non-biodegradable.
